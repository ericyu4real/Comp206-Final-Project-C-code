Assume I'm already in GDB by typing "$gdb labapp". Since I suspect that program may go wrong at function generateAttendance, I use "(gdb) list generateAttendance" to see which line does my generateAttendance() function locate. After knowing the line number of  generateAttendance(), setting the breakpoint at this line number by command "(gdb) break line_number". Then executing command "(gdb) run labdata.csv attendance.csv" to run the executable until it stops at the breakpoint.
Now we have reached the function generateAttendance(), we run the function line by line by using command "(gdb) step" until we reach the first node. Then printing the address of the pointer by "print <pointer>" command and find the bug.
Finally, using "(gdb) quit" to quit the gdb window and end the session.
